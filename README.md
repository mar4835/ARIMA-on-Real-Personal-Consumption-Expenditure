# ARIMA-on-Real-Personal-Consumption-Expenditure
Contains Rmd and HTML of ARIMA, residual analysis, and forecasting/accuracy measures. 

I initially performed ARIMA on the entire time series of Real Personal Consumption Expenditure from 2014-2024. However, it was evident that the 2020 pandemic caused a huge dip in the time series. To eliminate this component, I performed another ARIMA model using data after 2020, specifically beginning Q2 of 2021. The MAPE significantly improved from 1.04% to 0.386%.
